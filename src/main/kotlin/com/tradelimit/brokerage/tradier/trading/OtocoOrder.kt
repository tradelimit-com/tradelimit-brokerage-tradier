 *
 * What is a One-Triggers-a One-Cancels-the-Other (OTOCO) order?
 *
 * A One-Triggers-a One Cancels the-Other orders involves two orders-a primary order and two secondary orders. The primary order
 * may be a live order in the marketplace while the secondary orders, held in a separate order file, are not.
 * If the primary order executes in full, the secondary orders are released to the marketplace as a One-Cancels-the-Other order (OCO).
 * The execution of either leg of the OCO order triggers an attempt to cancel the unexecuted order. Partial executions
 * will also trigger an attempt to cancel the other order. An OTOCO order can be made up of stock orders, single-leg option
 * orders, or a combination of both. It is possible during volatile market conditions that both legs of an OCO could receive
 * executions. It is also possible that one order receives a delayed execution, resulting in the execution of both orders.
 *
 * Tradier Notes.
 * Please note these specific validations:
 * type must be different for both legs.
 * If both orders are equities, the symbol must be the same.
 * If both orders are options, the option_symbol must be the same.
 * If sending duration per leg, both orders must have the same duration.
